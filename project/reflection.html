                        3 things that made this game my number 1 favorite for a long, long time:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The storytelling was so good to the point where I couldn't wait to watch the next cutscenes.</li>
                            <li>The character buildings are very captivating. I'm now a fan of Bajie, that pig who reminds me of that friend who's always a jerk in front of us, but will do everything to help when we are in trouble.</li>
                            <li>The graphics are top-notch. Just look at the grassland where Violet Spider died. When the wind blows, we can see the flower powder, wilted leaves, their long hair, all moving in the same direction. It was cinema-quality, really close to pixel studio. This game is amazing. A rare one. Worth every cent of the price.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <p>Still makes me go crazy that they visited and studied the actual mythology and character so well. The animation couldnâ€™t be more accurate.</p>

                        On the surface, <em>Journey to the West</em> is about defeating demons and monsters, but at a deeper level, it discusses the struggles and transactions between ruling, being ruled, and political factions. It reflects the resistance of the Great Sage (the people). Written in the 16th century, it describes the social rights rules of that time, but it remains relevant for today's society, even in interpreting social rules in most countries.
