            <h3>Actual Page</h3>
            <p>A single-player action role-playing game called Black Myth: Wukong is based on the Journey to the West. The game uses the narrative of Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West, one of the four great novels of China, as a preface to tell the story of Sun Wukong, who abandoned his position as a Buddha and set off the Heavenly Court's conquest of him once more following the search for the scriptures. In order to discover the truth behind the historical legend, players will assume the character of a "Heavenly Ordained Man" and set off on a perilous and unexpected journey to the West.</p>
