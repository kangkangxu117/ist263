        <h1>Kangkang Xu's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            When I was 10 years old, I was introduced to computers for the first time. I was at first just addicted to the novelty that computers brought to me. Most of the time it was used for chatting with friends and playing video games. As I grew up, computers became an important role in my study and leisure.

            I became interested in coding when I was first introduced to it in high school. Then later, I learned that I could make a lot of <strong>money</strong> through coding. So I decided to study a code-related major in college.
